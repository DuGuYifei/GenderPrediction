## Intro
This is a task to:
1. train a simple model to predict the gender.
2. deploy the model as a REST API by flask.
3. write a request.py send request by form-data.
4. write a simple web page to interact with the API and display result.

## How to run
### Environment + Server
In windows, open cmd and run:
```
./run.cmd
```
It will execute the following commands:
```
# pip install -r requirements.txt
# python server.py
```

### Request

python request.py
```
Or you can open the webpage (`request.html`) in your browser to interact with the API.
